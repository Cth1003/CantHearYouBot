# CantHearYouBot
Python praw code for the reddit bot, /u/CantHearYoubot

#How this bot works
##Usage 1

*person x*: Is the horse not beat enough yet?

*person y*: wut?

*/u/CantHearYouBot*: **IS THE HORSE NOT BEAT ENOUGH YET?**

The bot will look through all the comments on reddit, find a comment that triggers it (trigger list below) and shouts the content of the comment above.



This bot will not work if a comment is a reply to a post, only if it is a reply to a comment.

***
##Usage 2

*person x*: what?

*person y*: wut

*/u/CantHearYouBot*: in da but

This is a reference to the popular song "What what (in the butt)", in which one of the recurring lines is "What What, In the butt".


***
##Triggers
These are the words that the bot is looking for. Every one of these will trigger the bot to shout and thus, are called triggers.

###Trigger list:    
'What', 'what', 'WHAT', 'What?', 'what?', 'WHAT?',    
'Wut', 'wut', 'WUT', 'Wut?', 'wut?', 'WUT?',    
'Wat', 'wat', 'WAT', 'Wat?', 'wat?', 'WAT?'
